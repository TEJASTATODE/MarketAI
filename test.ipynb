The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers.\\n\\nEven before that, the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla.\\n\\nAfter spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House, Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president\\'s DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce. [...] Musk also endorsed Germany\\'s extremist anti-immigrant party, AfD, and later supported British anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson. In recent weeks, Musk has called to abolish the European Union.\\n\\nPartly in response to Musk\\'s incendiary rhetoric, Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S. The company hasn\\'t fully recovered despite introducing a new, more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October.\\n\\nHowever, Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year, jumping 40% in the third quarter, reaching a fresh record in mid-December.Musk bought $1 billion worth of shares in September. [...] Tesla\\'s European registrations fell 39% in the first 11 months of 2025, while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240% in Europe. Overall, battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025, amounting to around 16% of all new vehicles sold there.\\n\\nSome analysts project that sales of Tesla\\'s more affordable Model Y standard, which the company launched in October, will help the company regain ground in coming quarters.\\n\\nIn a note last week, analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption \"is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam and Brazil, where robust consumer interest could create meaningful long-term upside for Tesla, even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers.\"',\n",
